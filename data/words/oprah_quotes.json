      "You can receive a lot of awards in your life, but there is nothing better, nothing better than being honored by your own.",

      "Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody's going to know whether you did it or not.",

      "Unless you choose to do great things with it, it makes no difference how much you are rewarded, or how much power you have.",
      "Every time you state what you want or believe, you're the first to hear it. It's a message to both you and others about what you think is possible. Don't put a ceiling on yourself.",
      "For everyone of us that succeeds, it's because there's somebody there to show you the way out. The light doesn't always necessarily have to be in your family; for me it was teachers and school.",

      "The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams.",

      "I believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear.",
      "Whatever you fear most has no power - it is your fear that has the power.",
      "Energy is the essence of life. Every day you decide how you're going to use it by knowing what you want and what it takes to reach that goal, and by maintaining focus.",
